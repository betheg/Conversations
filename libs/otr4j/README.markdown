## Synopsis

otr4j is an implementation of the [OTR (Off The Record) protocol][1]
in java. Its development started during the Google Summer of Code 2009
where the goal was to add support for OTR in [jitsi][2]. It currently
supports OTRv1, [OTRv2][] and [OTRv3][]. For a quick introduction on how to use
the library have a look at the [DummyClient](src/test/java/net/java/otr4j/session/DummyClient.java).
